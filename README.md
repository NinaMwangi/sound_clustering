#  Sound Dataset Clustering
This project aims to apply clustering techniques to an unlabeled sound dataset, analyze the necessity of dimensionality reduction, and compare different clustering methods. I will experiment with feature visualization, clustering performance metrics, and interpretability.

## Task
To cluster the data and analyze the performance of different clustering algorithms

### Process
- Data Loading and Feature Extraction
  - Feature Extraction & Initial Visualization (Without Dimensionality Reduction)
  - Extract relevant features (Mel Spectrogram) from the sound data.
  - Attempt to visualize the features using scatter plots, pair plots, or other relevant techniques without dimensionality reduction.
- Question: Why is dimensionality reduction important?
- Applying PCA and t-SNE for dimensionality reduction and Comparing the visualizations generated by both techniques.   
  - I selected 3 components and Visualized them in 3D.
  - Question: Which method provides better separability of clusters and why based on code outputs.
- Clustering the Sound Data:
  - Implementing K-Means and DBSCAN for clustering.
  - Optimizing the number of clusters for K-Means using the elbow method and silhouette score.
  - Comparing whether the discovered clusters match the actual classes.
- Evaluating Clustering Performance. Comparing K-Means and DBSCAN in terms of:
  - Cluster compactness and separation (e.g., inertia, silhouette score,  Davies-Bouldin index.).
  - Visual interpretability (scatter plots, t-SNE, PCA visualizations).
  - Question: Why does one algorithm perform better or worse based on, interpretation and Analysis. 
  - Explaining why certain clustering methods performed better in the experiments.
  - Justifying why dimensionality reduction improved clustering quality (or not) using the outputs and visualizations.
